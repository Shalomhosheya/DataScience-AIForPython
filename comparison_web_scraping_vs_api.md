# Comparison of Web Scraping vs. API-Based Data Retrieval

| Feature                 | **Web Scraping** | **API-Based Retrieval** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Speed & Efficiency**  | Slow, requires parsing HTML. | Fast, structured JSON/XML response. |
| **Reliability**         | Prone to breakage if website structure changes. | Stable, as APIs are designed for data access. |
| **Legal & Ethical Issues** | Can violate website terms; some sites block scrapers. | Official APIs are legally safer. |
| **Ease of Use**         | Requires HTML parsing, handling errors, and dealing with site updates. | Easier to use, well-documented with structured responses. |
| **Access to Data**      | Can extract **any publicly available** data (e.g., articles, stock info, images). | Limited to what the API provides (structured stock data only). |
| **Security Measures**   | Websites may block scrapers with CAPTCHAs and IP bans. | Secure and authorized access with API keys. |
| **Real-time Data**      | Not reliable for real-time stock data. | Provides **real-time & historical** market data. |
| **Rate Limits**         | No restrictions but may face IP bans. | APIs often have request limits (e.g., 5 calls per minute). |
| **Scalability**         | Hard to scale due to anti-scraping measures. | Easily scalable for enterprise use. |
| **Best For**           | Extracting **news, blogs, and extra insights** along with stock data. | **Fast, structured, and real-time** stock market analysis. |

## ðŸš€ Conclusion:
- **Use APIs** whenever available for **fast, reliable, and legal** stock market data.  
- **Use Web Scraping** only if APIs **donâ€™t provide the required data** (e.g., extracting financial news or additional insights).
